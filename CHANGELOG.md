## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository, pnpm workspace, shared type package, API package skeleton, CI.
- API service (Fastify) with `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `GET /api/v1/capabilities`; one error envelope on every failure.
- SQL migration runner; migrations apply automatically when the API starts. Two database roles so that row-level security is enforced on application queries.
- Background worker on pg-boss with a heartbeat job.
- Web app shell (React) showing the connection state and server version.
- `Dockerfile` with `api`, `worker` and `web` targets, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml` (MinIO, Mailpit), and `scripts/gen-env.mjs`.
- CI runs integration tests against PostgreSQL and builds the three images; tagged releases push to GHCR.
- Households, members and accounts, with row-level security on every tenant table enforced in PostgreSQL.
- First-run setup (`POST /api/v1/setup`), password sign-in (Argon2id), short-lived access tokens with rotating refresh tokens and reuse detection, device list and per-device sign-out.
- Append-only, hash-chained audit log; the worker verifies every household's chain nightly.
- Web app: first-run wizard, sign-in, signed-in devices.
