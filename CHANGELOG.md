## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Repository, pnpm workspace, shared type package, API package skeleton, CI.
- API service (Fastify) with `/healthz`, `/readyz` and `GET /api/v1/capabilities`; one error envelope on every failure.
- SQL migration runner; migrations apply automatically when the API starts. Two database roles so that row-level security is enforced on application queries.
- Background worker on pg-boss with a heartbeat job.
- Web app shell (React) showing the connection state and server version.
- `Dockerfile` with `api`, `worker` and `web` targets, `docker-compose.yml`, `docker-compose.dev.yml` (MinIO, Mailpit), and `scripts/gen-env.mjs`.
- CI runs integration tests against PostgreSQL and builds the three images; tagged releases push to GHCR.
- Households, members and accounts, with row-level security on every tenant table enforced in PostgreSQL.
- First-run setup (`POST /api/v1/setup`), password sign-in (Argon2id), short-lived access tokens with rotating refresh tokens and reuse detection, device list and per-device sign-out.
- Append-only, hash-chained audit log; the worker verifies every household's chain nightly.
- Web app: first-run wizard, sign-in, signed-in devices.
- Key hierarchy: household, adults and per-member scope keys minted at setup, wrapped by the master key; member keys additionally wrapped by the member's password. Chunked AES-256-GCM file encryption with range decryption. `FDV_MASTER_KEY_FILE` and a `rotate-master-key` command.
- Storage: a local-disk vault (created and tested at setup) and any S3-compatible bucket, added from the Storage screen with provider presets and a Test that must pass before use. Every write is verified by SHA-256; bucket credentials are stored encrypted.
- Documents: 22 built-in document types; create, read, update (with ETags), soft-delete and restore; dates with day/month/year precision; status derived from the type's rules; list with filters, sorts and cursors; tags with counts. Versions: upload (type detected from the bytes, encrypted per version, idempotent on a client key, size-capped), download byte-identical with `Range` support, and `POST /capture` for a photo with no details yet.
